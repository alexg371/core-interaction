    <p>I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
    &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
    he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
    almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
    met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
    twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
    say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were different.

    <br>
    I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
    the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
    yet alluring is that beyond the aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
    I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
    I connected with the pieces even though I could not necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my true
    journey into the concept of negative space in relation to perspective, awareness, and connotation began.</p>
