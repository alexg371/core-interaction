        <!--  I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
          &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
          he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
          almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
          met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
          twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
          say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
          the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
          yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
          I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
          I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
          journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
          the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light. -->

          I wanted my work of suburban homemaking to connect to something true and lovely about faith. And I think it probably does. But no matter how hard I tried, how many pages I wrote that winter, I couldn’t find the connecting point.
          During a meeting with my writing group later that spring, I burst into tears, confessing that it wasn’t working, that none of it was working. I had only a few months until my first book deadline, and I had pages and pages that would never, it felt, add up to a book – at least not the one I had hoped to write.
          And the consensus that night, spoken gently and ringing devastatingly true to my ear was this: Maybe this is not your work right now.
          This might be a crazy idea, one of the women said. But have you thought about writing about your road trip? It seems like there was something urgent and important about that.

          I’m heading to the Festival of Faith and Writing in Grand Rapids tomorrow morning, and so I’ve been thinking this week a lot about writing and process and the mysterious work of creativity.
          I’ve been thinking about all of those months that I spent writing something that didn’t end up being the thing. All those words filed on my computer in a folder called “Book 2 – Take 1.” Is there a purpose in this idling work? In creative output that doesn’t seem to land anywhere in particular?
          It’s a question about my work, but it’s also a question about my life and about its meaning. What I want to know is this: Is all this work wasted?
          Does this matter too?
