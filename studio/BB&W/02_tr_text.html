        <!--  I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
          &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
          he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
          almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
          met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
          twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
          say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
          the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
          yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
          I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
          I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
          journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
          the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light. -->

The way in which we understand and relate to negative space as a society is quite archaic –– limiting even.  In order for us to truly cognize such a conception on a much larger scale, we must remove the bounds that often surround it. Once allowing it to be free of all restriction, we will finally be able to see and study the multidimensionality of something whose complexity is often disregarded

I find much of the restrictive nature present within negative space stems from the way we commonly define it. Historically, people view it within the realm of art, attributing a definition of the space around and between the subject(s) of an image. In this regard, such a classification does the idea of negative space some justice, but the implications are way too reductive.
