        <!--  I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
          &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
          he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
          almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
          met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
          twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
          say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
          the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
          yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
          I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
          I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
          journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
          the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light. -->

          In art, there is a concept called negative space – the empty space around and between the subjects of a piece of art. Negative space is important in that it helps to define the boundaries of what is actually there. It brings balance.
          I’ve started to think about that first take on the book as a kind of weighted, negative space in my book and in my life. I started to write about faith home and instead found myself running away. I tried to rebuild my deconstructed faith, but as I did, my foot punched through a rotted floorboard that had to do with feeling God…one that I didn’t know was still there.
          What started as an attempt to rebuild turned into a journey toward making peace with the empty space that remains when your old ways of believing fall flat.
          And this matters.
          <br>
          <br>
          It matters how we get to the place where we end up. The roads we started to take and then didn’t – these add to the story, and I believe that because God is a God of abundance, of excess, of plenty, not one of these rabbit rails are wasted.
          Maybe someday I’ll write a book about faith home. Maybe not. But for now, it is there and not there. It’s the negative space, the invisible stitching at the back of the garment.
          You can’t see it, but it was a gift. It is not wasted. It holds so much together.
