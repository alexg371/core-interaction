              I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
              &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
              he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
              almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
              met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
              twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
              say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
              <br>
              <br>
              I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
              the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
              yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
              I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
              I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
              journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
              the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light.
