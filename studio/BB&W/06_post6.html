        <!--  I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
          &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
          he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
          almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
          met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
          twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
          say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
          the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
          yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
          I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
          I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
          journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
          the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light. -->

          We can begin to look at such conceptions of space within our lives and the ways in which we experience the world around us.

          Most of what we see are objects that occupy space, from the cup of coffee in your hand to the trees and buildings lining the street. We are surrounded by configurations of matter that pierce reality and comprise positive space. Not “positive” in the good sense of the word, but as yang is to yin: the opposite of the void that is negative space.

          <br>
          <br>
          It is through this shadowy emptiness that we walk, talk, see, and live; negative space is the impossible cellophane layer that drapes the known world and is invisible to all but to the most perceptive minds.
