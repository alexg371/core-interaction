        <!--  I came across the work of Arjan Janssen on a site Professor Hermon was raving about;
          &lsquo;butdoesitfloat.com is a resource you should all know of, it is filled with great images&rsquo;
          he said with tremendous surety & jurisdiction. In retrospect, he was right. I recall
          almost immediately having my attention arrested by the bare, disparate paintings that
          met my gaze once the webpage had finally loaded. Usually, I don&lsquo;t bat my eyelashes
          twice at fine art pieces that fall in the class of &ldquo;things vast majority of people
          say they can make themselves...&rdquo; but this time, <em>things</em> were quite different.
          <br>
          <br>
          I was captivated by the broad, powerful lines of black paint that Janssen used to mar the canvas,
          the unremitting &ldquo;empty&rdquo; spaces that took up most of the works entirely. What was most startling
          yet alluring is that beyond the bare aesthetic components of Janssen&lsquo;s art, which left me in awe on their own,
          I felt such a wealth of emotion. Emotion that stemmed from what spanned beyond the canvas itself.
          I connected with the pieces even though I couldn&lsquo;t necessarily deduce anything from them. And with that, my
          journey into the concept of negative space began. In the wake of such an exploration, I was led to see (and appreciate)
          the notions of perspective, awareness, and connotation in a new light. -->

          For six months and tens of thousands of words, I thought that the second book would be about faith home.
          I thought it would be about soil and suburbs and the small, important work of settling into your own life. I imagined I’d write out the slow process of building around you some healthier, sturdier kind of faith, and in doing so, I would figure it out myself.
          I read a memoir, once, by a woman who healed from her divorce by recreating and redesigning her home. Around the House and in the Garden, it was called. And I found it beautiful and powerful – the ways that those overstuffed chairs and rugs and bookshelves became outward manifestations of deep internal growth and change.
          I guess it stuck with me, because this is what I was thinking about when I slogged out a proposal for that second book.

          I had just released When We Were on Fire – a memoir deconstructing the faith of my adolescence. It felt like I’d spent the last several years pounding madly at crumbling drywall, taking the whole thing down. There I stood, covered in the dust of it, surrounded by the rubble, aching to build something new.
          I started to write about home.
          <br>
          <br>
          I wrote about our house search, which began in the tiny community of Taylor’s Falls, Minnesota and then looped crazily through Minneapolis and its Northern suburbs. I wrote about our odd, glassy-eyed realtor and about all the lives I imagined I’d have in all of those homes we walked through.
          I wrote thousands of words about the home we finally found – this 1980s suburban home with the pond opening up behind it like a hidden gift. I checked out books from the library on place and home, on the history of the suburbs, on the psychology of home design.
          I went so far as to go down to the Anoka County Historical Society to look at old maps of our neighborhood, our suburb back when it was gravel roads and a Christmas tree farm. I learned the name of the soil: loamy fine sand. I’d never heard the word loamy before then, but I liked the way it felt in my mouth.
          I wrote and I wrote and I wrote, and I tried to ignore the fact that it wasn’t working. That nothing about this book was working.
          <br>
          <br>
          The most beautiful part of memoir writing, for me, has always been the way that peering back into the ordinary moments of your life reveals hidden treasures and themes, and that as you write it, you begin to see how the seemingly disparate parts of your life were always connected.
